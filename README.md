# Human-in-the-Loop AutoML: Goals and Information Needs

If you want, feel free to scan a summarized [project description](Project%20Description.md), including the motivation, goals and targeted results.
We covered this already during the workshop introduction.


## Getting Started

### Web Editor

You can open this GitHub repository in the github.dev editor in your browser by pressing . (dot).


### Working Mode

Choose your working mode:
1. Start individually on the same pattern, then merge your ideas together.
2. Start individually on different patterns, then commit and rotate.
3. Select one person in your group to write and share their screen. You can periodically commit and switch the driver and observer role.
4. These are suggestions - work however you like.

Please make use of the group setting—discuss, challenge each other’s ideas, and refine the pattern collaboratively.


### Creating Patterns

Go to the ``workshop`` folder to start working on your first pattern using this [copy of template](workshop/1_Template_Copy.md).
Please use the [template](workshop/Template.md) and an [example](workshop/Example.md) to articulate your goals and information needs using AutoML in your projects.


### Ideation

It can help to think of a specific past project of yours.
Try to remember the stages from start to finish along the [ML Pipeline](ML%20Pipeline%20Overview.md).

* What goals did you persue in each stage or in general?
* Did you iterate over certain stages?
* What decisions did you take?
* What information was necessary to take a further step?

There are no wrong answers! We are very interested in your personal experiences, what you have learned so far, when you apply this knowledge and how it has payed off for you.
If you are unsure where to write down certain information, feel free to write it to the seemingly most appropriate point — do not skip it if it feels important.
The pattern is mostly a he,lpful representation of information and we will over multiple workshops merge, split, and refine all patterns.


## Review

### Presenting Group
One of each group should be prepared to present the patterns your group created.
During the presentation, either the moderator or the presenter of your group can share the pattern file as visual support.
It is not important to make a fluent presentation, but rather have grounds for discussion, questions and feedback.

### Listenting Group

Please share anything that feels unclear, confusing, or inconsistent with your own experience.

1. Clarity: Is the pattern easy to understand?
2. Completeness: Are any sections missing detail? Can you provide new detail?
3. Generalizability: Can you suggest contexts where the pattern holds as well? Or where not?
4. Duplication: Does this pattern overlap with another pattern?
5. Consistency: Is the pattern consistent with your experiences?
