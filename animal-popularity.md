🦒 Predictive Modeling of Animal Celebrity Status
Goal: To build a data-driven model that classifies and predicts the future celebrity status (fame level) of famous animals.

Methodology:

Data Collection: Gather quantitative and qualitative features (e.g., social media reach, media appearances, species type) related to animal fame.

Analysis (Pandas): Use Pandas for data cleaning, feature engineering (creating metrics like "Fame Velocity"), and detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

Visualization (Matplotlib): Visualize key relationships, such as the correlation between initial features and the final Fame Score.

Modeling: Apply a Classification Model to predict the target Fame Score (High/Medium/Low) for new subjects.

Key Deliverable: A robust classification system demonstrating which information patterns (features) are most predictive of sustained public recognition.
